### Just a little fun excercise for vim practice
Runs within the terminal. Keeps score along the way.

#### Dependencies
* getch - pypi package
* python3
* unicode support in terminal(now optional)

#### Features
* Keeps score
* Unforgiving - one mistake and game is over

#### Todo
- [x] Use figlet/toilet for larger display (has known bug #1)
- [x] Fall back mode when unicode is not supported
- [x] Also track time along with score
- [x] Calculate speed
- [ ] Accept command line options for fallback and giant mode
- [ ] More forgiving, and show hearts to keep track of mistakes
- [ ] Show next arrow(?)

#### If you don't like unicode
- Set the fallback option to `True`
- Or the giant option

#### Feel free to fork and give a star if you enjoy it! Thanks!!
